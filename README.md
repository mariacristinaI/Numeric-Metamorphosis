# Numeric Metamorphosis: A Creative Algorithm Repository ðŸ§®

The project contains a variety of successfully solved algorithms, each demonstrating creative and diverse approaches to manipulating input numbers. The focus of this personal challenge was to explore inventive methods for transforming numeric inputs, resulting in a collection of independent endeavors that showcase versatility in manipulating numbers.

Available commands that allow you to transform numbers or lists:
- Reverse last 2 digits
- Reverse all numbers
- Display the Fibonacci sequence
- Make a Pyramid pattern
- Make an upside down Pyramid pattern
- Make a column shape using the entered numbers
- Transform a list using the FizzBuzz algorithm
- Show only the even numbers from a list

All the solutions can be found within the specially designed terminal that includes an in-house cat explaining the purpose of each command.
